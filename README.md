Description
-----
To identify microRNA target site modification due to alternative polyadenylation (APA), either 3'UTR shortening or 3'UTR lengthening between normal and cancer cells, we developed a computational method (PRIMATA-APA) that first estimate the total number of target site for each microRNA with and without consieration of APA and estimate the statistical significance of the difference.
